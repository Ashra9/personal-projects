# NBA injuries Analysis (2010-2022)
Project analytics injury trends from 2010-2022 using Tableau




## Summary of Insights
- Time series by Season instead of by year as the NBA season does not start in Jan but usually around October. Did not count the ongoing 2022-2023 season

### Vs Time:
- Most injuries in the 2013-14 season which dropped off shortly afterward
- Recent 2021-22 season had increased injuries above the average - investigate whether there is an issue with the medical protocols or season schedule and training procedures.

### Teams' Player Attributes and injury comparison:
- Players Height and Weight does not affect the injury count as they are about the same across all teams but the no. of injuries differ significantly from team to team - Team managers therefore should not account for this in their players' injury risk potential but other factors instead
- Generally average age and usage rate of a team's injured players are not indicative of their injury rate compared to the other teams, unless a team is at the top of the average age and usage rate or the bottom like the Spurs and Thunder
- This is further supported by the injuries vs age graph which is very similar to the distribution of NBA player age  from 2010-2020s

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- Investigate why there seems to be a rise in injuries recently even with advanced medical technology with factors such as games played, quality of team medical staff and possibly expand to time spent on training as well as training schedules to further identify the trends
